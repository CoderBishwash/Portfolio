    <p data-aos="fade-in">I create the visual and interactive parts of websitesâ€”everything you see and click on. I use modern tools like Vue.js and React to build fast, responsive, and user-friendly experiences. My goal is to make sure what I build not only looks great but also works smoothly and is intuitive for anyone using it. I'm always learning new ways to make these experiences even better.</p>
    <p v-if="paragraph" data-aos="fade-in">I have had keen interest in designing and developing webpages and websites for quite a long time. I specialize in transforming design concepts into responsive, high-performance, and accessible websites. With a strong command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm dedicated to crafting clean, efficient code that not only looks great but also delivers seamless user interactions. My expertise also extends to Nuxt.js for server-rendered Vue applications and Android Studio for mobile development, offering a versatile skill set</p>
